    "The basic Pandas data structure is called a *Series*. It is a sequence, not unlike a numpy array, but with an associated set of labels for each value called the *index*. If you don't provide the index labels, Pandas will use the regular 0-based index as the label. Again: if you don't provide index labels, it will use the numeric index as the index label. That will be important later.\n",

You can also updated the index labels or reset the labels to the default.
